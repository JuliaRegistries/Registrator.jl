Registrator is a GitHub app that automates creation of registration pull requests for your julia packages to the [General](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General) registry.

#### How to use

1) Using a Pull Request:

Create a pull request on the package repo with your project file changes. Add `register()` as the content body of the pull request if you are a collaboarator on the package repository. If you are not a collaborator ask someone who is to comment `register()` on the Pull Request. This will make Registrator add a pull request to General by looking at your pull request branch.

2) Using an issue:

Raise an issue in the package you wish to register. Add `register()` somewhere in the content of the issue if you are a collaborator to trigger Registrator. If you are not a collaborator ask someone who is to comment `register()` on the issue. This will make Registrator add a pull request to General with the appropriate changes. Registrator will look for the project file in the master branch by default. To use a custom branch comment with `register(name-of-your-branch)`.

3) Using a commit comment:

On GitHub click on a commit that you wish to register. In the comment section below say `register()`. Note that you must be a collaborator in order to do this.
