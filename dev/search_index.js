At the homepage of the site, you'll be greeted by links to log in to either GitHub or GitLab. If you're registering a GitHub package, then log into GitHub, and likewise for GitLab.\nOnce authenticated, you'll see a text box to input the URL to your package repository. Do so, then press \"Submit\". The page might seem unresponsive for a while, but it'll get back to you within 10 seconds or so.\nIf everything worked out, then you should see a link to a new pull request in the registry! Sit back and let a registry maintainer complete the process for you. Otherwise, you'll see a (hopefully) informative reason for failure.\n\n<!– TODO: Screenshots. –>","category":"section"},{"location":"webui/#Setup-(For-Registry-Maintainers)","page":"Web UI","title":"Setup (For Registry Maintainers)","text":"This section is for people who want to host an instance of Registrator for their own registry.","category":"section"},{"location":"webui/#Provider-Setup","page":"Web UI","title":"Provider Setup","text":"Here, the term $PROVIDER indicates the provider of your registry repository.

The only real use case is when your registry is on a self-hosted GitHub or GitLab instance, and you also want to allow registering of packages from the public instance of that provider. The only two providers supported are GitHub and GitLab. If you do want to do this, then you should set web.extra_providers as mentioned above. The file should look like this:\n\nPROVIDERS[\"mygithub\"] = Provider(;\n    name=\"PrivateGitHub\",\n    client=GitHubAPI(;\n        url=\"https://api.github.mysite.com\",\n        token=Token(\"my_github_token\"),\n    ),\n    client_id=\"my_oauth_app_client_id\",\n    client_secret=\"my_oauth_app_client_secret\",\n    auth_url=\"https://github.mysite.com/oauth/authorize\",\n    token_url=\"https://github.mysite.com/oauth/token\",\n    scope=\"public_repo\",\n)\n\nPROVIDERS[\"mygitlab\"] = Provider(;\n    name=\"PrivateGitLab\",\n    client=GitLabAPI(;\n        url=\"https://gitlab.mysite.com/api/v4\",\n        token=PersonalAccessToken(\"my_gitlab_token\"),\n    ),\n    client_id=\"my_oauth_app_client_id\",\n    client_secret=\"my_oauth_app_client_secret\",\n    auth_url=\"https://gitlab.mysite.com/oauth/authorize\",\n    token_url=\"https://gitlab.mysite.com/oauth/token\",\n    scope=\"read_user\",\n    include_state=false,\n    token_type=OAuth2Token,\n)\n\nname: The text displayed on the authentication link.\nclient: A GitForge Forge with access to your provider.\nscope: Use public_repo for GitHub and read_user for GitLab.\ninclude_state: Leave out for GitHub and set false for GitLab.\ntoken_type: Leave out for GitHub and set OAuth2Token for GitLab.\n\nThe OAuth2 application info and URLs are covered above. When setting your OAuth2 application's callback URL, make sure that it ends with ?provider=$PROVIDER, where $PROVIDER is mygithub for the GitHub example above.","category":"section"},{"location":"webui/#Running-the-Server","page":"Web UI","title":"Running the Server","text":"To run the server, first add Registrator to your Julia environment. Then, make sure that your configuration file is written correctly. The following code will start the server:\n\nusing Registrator\nRegistrator.WebUI.main()\n\nA directory called registries will be created, which contains your registry. It's not important to keep it intact, as it is synchronized before registering any package.","category":"section"},{"location":"webui/#Basic-Recipe:-Public-Registry","page":"Web UI","title":"Basic Recipe: Public Registry","text":"Here's a general case of hosting a registry on GitHub and allowing package registrations from both GitHub and GitLab. The registry will be owned by RegistryOwner and the name will be MyRegistry. The web server will be hosted at https://myregistrator.com, and run on port 4000.\n\nThe first thing we'll do is set up a config.toml file with some information we already have.\n\nNote that in this and any following examples, the section names (i.e. [web]) will always be included for clarity. However, they should only appear once in the final file.\n\n[web]\nip = \"0.0.0.0\"\nport = 4000\nserver_url = \"https://myregistrator.com\"\nregistry_url = \"https://github.com/RegistryOwner/MyRegistry\"\n\nNext, we create the GitHub and GitLab users and API keys, and save those API keys:\n\n[web.github]\ntoken = \"abc...\"\n\n[web.gitlab]\ntoken = \"abc...\"\n\nNext, create OAuth2 applications for both of them. The callback URLs will be https://myregistrator.com/callback?provider=github and https://myregistrator.com/callback?provider=gitlab. Add the client IDs and secrets to our file:\n\n[web.github]\nclient_id = \"abc...\"\nclient_secret = \"abc...\"\n\n[web.gitlab]\nclient_id = \"abc...\"\nclient_secret = \"abc...\"\n\nNow let's configure Git and set up SSH authentication to GitHub.\n\nConfigure name and email by running these commands:\n\ngit config --global user.name Registrator\ngit config --global user.email registrator@myregistrator.com\n\nThen, create an SSH key with ssh-keygen, and hit enter a few times to generate a key. Now go to GitHub user settings and add the public key to your new user.\n\nTo actually use this key, we'll set the clone URL for our registry in .env:\n\n[web]\nregistry_clone_url = \"git@github.com:RegistryOwner/MyRegistry.git\"\n\nOur file is finished, and looks like this:\n\n[web]\nip = \"0.0.0.0\"\nport = 4000\nserver_url = \"https://myregistrator.com\"\nregistry_url = \"https://github.com/RegistryOwner/MyRegistry\"\nregistry_clone_url = \"git@github.com:RegistryOwner/MyRegistry.git\"\n\n[web.github]\ntoken = \"abc...\"\nclient_id = \"abc...\"\nclient_secret = \"abc...\"\n\n[web.gitlab]\ntoken = \"abc...\"\nclient_id = \"abc...\"\nclient_secret = \"abc...\"\n\nNow that this is done, we're ready to run the server. Since our config file is at the default location (config.toml), we don't need to pass any arguments.\n\n# Instalation: Just do this once.\njulia -e '\n    using Pkg;\n    Pkg.add(\"https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl\")'\n\n# Run this every time.\njulia -e '\n    using Registrator;\n    Registrator.WebUI.main()'","category":"section"},{"location":"webui/#Basic-Recipe:-Private-Registry","page":"Web UI","title":"Basic Recipe: Private Registry","text":"This guide will be almost identical to the one above, but we'll set up a private, self-hosted registry and only allow packages from that provider.\n\nLet's assume we're running a GitLab instance at https://git.corp.com, and our repo is at Registries/General. We want to host our instance at https://registrator.corp.com.\n\nFirst, let's again start off with a TOML file, but this time at myconfig.toml:\n\n[web]\nregistry_provider = \"gitlab\"\n\n[web.gitlab]\napi_url = \"https://git.corp.com/api/v4\"\nauth_url = \"https://git.corp.com/oauth/authorize\"\ntoken_url = \"https://git.corp.com/oauth/token\"\nregistry_url = \"https://git.corp.com/Registries/General\"\nserver_url = \"https://registrator.corp.com\"\n\nAs you can see, We had to set a few URLs manually. Additionally, we set registry_provider = \"gitlab\" because the string \"gitlab\" does not occur in our registry's URL.\n\nNext, we create our user, API key, and OAuth application. Make sure to enable the read_user scope, and to set the callback URL to https://registrator.corp.com/callback?provider=gitlab.\n\nAdd our credentials to the file:\n\n[web.gitlab]\ntoken = \"abc...\"\nclient_id = \"abc...\"\nclient_secret = \"abc...\"\n\nWe'll do the same Git configuration as before, and set our clone URL appropriately:\n\n[web]\nregistry_clone_url = \"git@git.corp.com:Registries/General\"\n\nAnd then we're ready. We can run it in the same way as before, but passing our non-default config path:\n\njulia -e '\n    using Registrator;\n    Registrator.WebUI.main(\"myconfig.toml\")'\n\nNote for private packages: Organization settings can sometimes restrict third party applications like Registrator from using an OAuth token to read a private repository.

Authenticating as a user with elevated permissions may pose a security risk. Note that this is true regardless of whether the registry is private, since GitHub personal access tokens do not currently provide sufficiently granular access permissions.\n\nOnce such an account is created, create a personal access token for it for authentication.\n\nIn run/config.commentbot.toml in the [commentbot.github] section, set the following:\n\nuser: The GitHub username for the account.\ntoken: A personal access token for authenticating as this user.\n\nIn the [commentbot] section, set trigger to @<user>.","category":"section"},{"location":"commentbot/#The-GitHub-App","page":"Comment Bot","title":"The GitHub App","text":"A GitHub App is required to use the comment bot.
